		This is a program that is designed just to tinker around with
		channels, context and select statement

		Current setup:
			Async logger gets triggered every tick of 1 second
					For every tick, the logger has 500ms to log the buffred msgs

			The publishers are a set of 30 goroutines, fired in a loop
				Every 3 go routines, we sleep for 1/4 of a second
				(which means that every 1/4 second, 3 msg get bufferd)


		Quick rundown:	(small subset of a complete execution)

			We create our async logger
			We set the autoflush to flush in every tick
			we enter the loop i == 0,
				we sleep for 1/4 		(750ms remaining for the next tick)
				we quickly fire 3 msg
				we sleep for 1/4		(500ms remaining for the next tick)
				we quickly fire 3 msg
				we sleep for 1/4		(250ms remaining for the next tick)
				we quickly fire 3 msg
				we sleep for 1/4

				in parallel (
					first tick is fired
						we consume the 12 msg
						we wait for others until the deadline of 500 ms is met

					we quicly fire 3 msg
					we sleep for 1/4
				)

		During the last part (where the tick is fired) , we will intecept the
		newly fired 3 msgs before the 500ms deadline, and that is why in the
		console, the first tick contains 15msgs at once.

		An intersting question is that since in the 'in-parallel' part of the
		above quick run down we sleep for 1/4s and we have a 500ms deadline, why
		can't we squeeze in the extra 3messages (cuz 500ms = 2 * 1/4ms), is is because
		we are doing IO in this example or is it something else ?
